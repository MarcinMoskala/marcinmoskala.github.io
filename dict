There is much confusion around the difference between methods and
function. Common definitions are as follows:

A function is a piece of code that is called by name.
The method is a function associated with an instance of class (object).
Sometimes it is called member function.
So in simpler words, functions inside classes are called methods. In Java,
there are officially only methods, but academic environments are often
arguing that static Java methods are in fact functions. In Kotlin we can
define functions that are not associated with any object.

Parameters versus arguments
In the programming community, there is a difference between arguments
and parameters. These words cannot be used interchangeably because
they have different meanings. An argument is an actual value that is
passed to the function when a function is called. However, parameter
refers to the variables declared inside function declaration. Consider the
following example:
fun printSum(a1: Int, a2: Int) { // 1.
print(a1 + a2)
}
add(3, 5) // 2.
1 - a1 and a2 are parameters
2 - 3 and 5 are arguments

function vs procedure

first-class citizen
A first-class citizen, in a given programming language, is a term that describes an entity that
supports all the operations generally available to other entities. These operations typically
include being passed as an argument, returned from a function, and assigned to a variable.
