#### Guidelines for Marcin Moska≈Ça presentations and workshops on conferences

I am open for invitations for conferences, and I am thrilled to share the knowledge during Kotlin presentations and workshops, although I have some requirements.
When you invite me as a speaker for a conference or a meetup, I expect covering travel expenses including:
* Flight
* Hotel with a breakfast

If you invite me, I assume the travel expenses will be covered.

I might make an exception only when:
* I will appear as a keynote speaker in front of more than 300 people.
* I will appear on a discussion panel.

Please, do not place my presentation before 10 am or as the last presentation in the day unless it is opening or closing keynote.

I am open to making more than one presentation or workshop. I actually prefere an option with both a presentation and a workshop or two presentations. It makes the time spent on travel more rewarding.
