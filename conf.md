#### Conferences guidelines

When you invite me as a speaker for a conference or meetup, it is expected that you cover full travel costs including:
* Flight
* Hotel with a breakfest

If you are not planning to cover those, please, do not bother with invitation. If you do invite me, I assume those as expected. 

I might make an exception only when:
* I am to appear as a keynote speaker in front of more then 500 people.
* I am to appear on a discussion panel. 

When I am to participate in a conference, I can make more then one presentation. It is actually a preferred option as it makes time spent on travel relatively less costly.

Please, do not place my presentation before 10 am or as the last presentation in the day undless it is to be opening or closing keynote.
